# Thai Combination Fried Rice
![recipe image](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/23/dining/thai-combination-fried-rice/thai-combination-fried-rice-articleLarge.jpg)
This dish is loosely based on Thailand’s ubiquitous fried rice dish, kao pad. Usually some kind of animal protein accompanies the rice — squid, crabmeat, ham, chicken, whatever the cook has on hand. My version relies instead on tofu and vegetables; the most important ingredients are the rice itself, the garlic and the fish sauce. Have all of your ingredients prepared and close to the stove. Cooking goes very quickly.

## Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
* 8 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced small or cut in julienne
* 4 ounces tofu, patted dry and cut in 1/2-inch dice
* 4 eggs, beaten and seasoned with salt and pepper
* 5 cups cooked rice, preferably Thai jasmine rice available in markets that sell Asian foods
* 2 to 3 tablespoons Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce (to taste)
* 2 to 3 teaspoons Thai or Indonesian chile sauce (to taste)
* 1 tomato, chopped
* 1 bunch scallions, both white and green parts, chopped

FOR THE GARNISH
* ½ cup chopped cilantro
* Thinly sliced cucumber
* Lime wedges
* Scallions
* Fish sauce with hot chiles nam pla prik or half the amount of soy sauce

## Steps
1. Heat a large wok or large, heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water evaporates upon contact.
2. Add the oil and swirl, then add the carrot and tofu. Stir-fry until lightly colored, about two minutes. Add the garlic and stir-fry until golden, about 30 seconds.
3. Pour in the beaten egg. Stir-fry until scrambled, then add the rice. Cook the rice — scooping it up and pressing it into the pan, then scooping it up again — for about two minutes.
4. Add the fish, chile sauces, tomato and chopped scallions, then stir together for about a half-minute. 
5. Serve, garnishing each plate with the cilantro and cucumbers and passing lime wedges, scallions and fish sauce with chiles. Diners should squeeze lime juice onto their rice as they eat.
