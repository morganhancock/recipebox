# Egg-in-a-Hole
Unsalted butter, a thick slice of really good white or whole wheat country bread, and a sunflower-yellow, pastured egg is all you need for this utterly perfect meal.

## Ingredients
* 1 Â¾-inch-thick slice country bread, whole wheat or white
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
*  Salt and pepper

## Steps
1. Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut a hole in the middle of bread. Reserve the removed portion to toast, if desired. Break egg into a teacup.
2. Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, or over a medium-hot grill, for about 2 minutes. Add butter. When butter stops foaming, place bread in pan and reduce heat to medium. Cook 3 minutes and flip over. Gently tip egg into hole.
3. Sprinkle salt and pepper over egg and cook 3 minutes. Carefully flip egg and bread over, and cook for another 30 to 40 seconds, until egg is cooked just over-easy. Transfer to a plate and serve.
