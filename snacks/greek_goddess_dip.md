# Greek Goddess Dip
This Greek goddess dip is stunningly verdant and has a bright herby flavor. The Greek strain in this dressing comes from using dill in place of watercress. Make it and watch it do a disappearing act on vegetables, pita chips or whatever conduit you can dream up.

## Ingredients
* ½ cup packed fresh dill
* ½ cup packed fresh mint
* ½ cup packed fresh parsley
* ⅓ cup packed fresh basil
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped
* 2 scallions, white and green parts, sliced
* 1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
* Pinch kosher salt, more to taste
* ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
* ½ cup Greek yogurt
* ¼ cup mayonnaise, optional
* Raw chopped vegetables or pita chips, for serving

## Steps
1. Place dill, mint, parsley, basil, garlic, scallions, lemon juice and salt in a food processor and process until finely chopped.
2. With motor running, drizzle in the olive oil until incorporated. Add feta and process until smooth; pulse in yogurt. Taste dip and add more salt, if desired. If you like a creamier, richer dip, add mayonnaise and pulse to combine.
3. Serve dip immediately with vegetables or pita chips or cover and store in refrigerator for up to 3 days.
