# Recipebox
Recipebox is a sandbox for learning and exploring Git.

## Usage
Clone or fork this repo and work through the exercises. You can also come up with your own exercises and submit a pull request to get them into this project.

Make sure you have the following:
* GitHub desktop, Git shell, or another Git graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) 
* Text editor
* Knowledge of markdown (here's a helpful [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))

The exercises in this project provide commands for use with a CLI. If you aren't comfortable using a CLI, you can use a GUI but you'll need to adapt the commands on your own.
